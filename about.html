            <p class="about-me-text">As I approach my final semester at the University of Miami’s School of Architecture, I'm diving deep into the worlds of hospitality, interior architecture, and entertainment. My focus is on creating spaces that do more than just look cool—they need to be immersive, functional, and full of energy. Whether it's the grand design of a luxury hotel in Central Park or the intricate details of a custom vanity for a primary bathroom, I’m all about crafting environments that evoke emotion and spark joy.

                I’ve had the privilege of working alongside Tomas Lopez Gottardi, architect and UM professor, creating renderings for his publication on Caribbean villas. Collaborating with such a local legend sharpened my design perspective and taught me how to bring complex ideas to life. I'm always on the lookout for the latest tech, from mastering commands in AutoCAD and Rhino to exploring cutting-edge rendering software like Enscape and Twinmotion.

                Outside the studio, my passion for hospitality and design extends to hosting memorable gatherings, shooting 35mm photographs, and sketching furniture concepts. I can curate the perfect dinner party or design a floating theater for the Venice Biennale and I see it all as creating experiences that make people marvel at their surroundings while feeling completely at home.</p>
